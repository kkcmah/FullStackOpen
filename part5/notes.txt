Returning to frontend in this part. Looking at different possibilities for testing React code
Implement token based authentication for user login
===part a login in frontend===
form with fields that synchronize changes in the field with the state in component
conditionally render components {user === null ?
      loginForm() :
      noteForm()
    }
put headers into config in third parameter passed via axios
 const config = {
    headers: { Authorization: token },
  }

  const response = await axios.post(baseUrl, newObject, config)
can save token to local storage which is a key value database in browser
window.localStorage.setItem('name', 'juha tauriainen')
window.localStorage.getItem('name')
removeItem removes an item
storage is origin specific so each web app has its own storage
have to save objects using JSON.stringify
and use JSON.parse with getting objects
use effect hook to check local storage
empty array as hooks dependency array ensures it is only run when component is rendered for the first time
log out a user by removing the key from localStorage
